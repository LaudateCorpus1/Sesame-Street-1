        <h1>Things I find on the internet</h1>
        <p>The internet is a <i>large</i> and <i>wonderful</i> and <i>hilarious</i> place with lots to offer. Too many times I thought I was looking up something and get misdirected only to then find myself getting sucked in to the animated loop on <a href="http://thisadvertisinglife.tumblr.com/">This Advertisng Life</a> or to find <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbruyVXYHIk">a cat that finds himself in a precarious situation with a bathtub</a>.

          <blockquote cite="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/keywords/internet.html">The Internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow.
            <p><strong>-Bill Gates</strong></p></blockquote>

        <p>
          In the coming weeks I will be posting things I find or come across here. 
          <ul>
          <li><a href="images/index">Images!</a></li>
          <li><a href="Animated_Gifs/index">Animated Gifs!</a></li>
          <li><a href="Videos/index">Videos!</a></li>
          </ul>

          Enjoy!
        </p>
