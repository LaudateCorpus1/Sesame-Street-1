      <h2> About us </h2>
  				
  				<p>Textile designing is a creative field that bridges fashion design, carpet manufacturing and any other cloth-related field.
            <br>Textile design fulfills so many purposes in our lives. For example:</br></p>
          <ul>
            <li>People climb out from under sheets and blankets and step into slippers and a robe.</li>
            <li>People wash our faces with washcloths, dry them with towels, and put on clothing for the day.</li>
            <li>People sit on upholstered seats; the vehicle moves on tires reinforces with strong textile cord.</li>
          </ul>

            <p>The above examples illustrate the importance of textile in our daily lives. Also, these examples give the idea to the textile designer to consider the contribution of the performance to the finished fabric, because the design from the designer gives a direct influence on the performance, durability and attractiveness of a final product. It embodies not only drawing skill but also business savvy of the global textile industry and consumer relations as well.</p>
            Textile designers marry a creative vision of what a finished textile will look like with a deep understanding of the technical aspects of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_manufacturing">production</a> and the
            properties of <ins>fiber</ins>, <ins>yarn</ins>, and <ins>dyes</ins>

            <p>Designs for both woven and printed textiles often begin with a drawing or watercolor sketch of the finished design. Traditionally, drawings of woven textile patterns were translated onto special forms of <ins>graph paper</ins> called <em>point papers</em> which were used by the weavers in setting up their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loom">looms</a>.</p>
