				<p>The Black Keys is a rock band that's been around for 10+ years but only recently has BLOWN up big time. Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney, the founding members, were childhood friends who started the band out of a garage in their hometown of Akron, Ohio.</p>
			
				<p> At Coachella 2012 they played directly following PULP on the Mainstage.  It was a killer show and they even brought out John Fogerty to play a song with them, which was epic.  This was a tribute to the late Levon Helm of The Band and they played a version of "The Weight," a song from The Band.Here's a 	<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/the-black-keys-with-john-fogerty-pay-tribute-to-levon-helm-20120423">recording</a> featured in Rolling Stone, enjoy!</p>
			
				<p> My friend had tried to get me to go their show at Madison Square Garden the week before, and I'm so glad I waited because I honestly had no idea what to expect &#40;I obviously knew I loved the band&#41;, but never imagined their show would be so incredible.  My two favorites were definitely <q>Howlin' For You</q> and <q>Lonely Boy</q> hands down!</p>
