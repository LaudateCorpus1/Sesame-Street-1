        For the last couple of weeks I have been keeping stats for all the ping pong games played between all the different people on the creative team. I would like to create a website that visually express each of our stats <em>(and how much time we have waisted)</em>.

    <h2>A few ideas</h2>
  </hgroup>
      <ul>
        <li>Display stats in a <strong>digestible</strong> way</li>
        <li>Find <strong>creative</strong> ways to display these stats</li>
        <li>Use fun interactions to create a <strong>memorable</strong> experience</li>
      </ul>
