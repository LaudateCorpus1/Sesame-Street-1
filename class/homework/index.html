		<p>This is going to be a place to document all of the <i>amazing</i>, <b>WILD</b>, and just all around absurd times my friends and I have had at all of the various concerts, shows, and festivals that we've attended and will be attending.</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.coachella.com">Coachella</a>, a music Festival in Southern California started the <s>debauchery</s> insanity of everything that has <a href="the-past.html">followed</a></p><b />
		
		<p>and is yet to come:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.madeinamericafest.com/">Made In America</a></li>
			<li>Coldplay</li>
		</ul>	
		</p>

		<p>There is so much yet to come and so much more that went into the past few months that is will take some creative and <em>HARD</em> thinking to document it all.</p>
