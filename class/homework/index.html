        <section class="introduction">
               <h2>Hello!</h2>
               <p>I'm a user experience designer for web, mobile, and applications. I live in Brooklyn, New York and work on the mobile team at Gilt. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gilt-on-the-go/id331804452?mt=8">We make awesome things.</a> </p>
        
                <p>I love to make experiences more meaningful through research, analysis, and solving interaction design problems. I've worked with startups and Fortune 500 companies Including: ESPN, Tiffany &amp; Co., Chorus, beRecruited, and Wolf-Gordon. </p>

              <p> I've always enjoyed making things. I have an MA and BA in General Fine Art from Maryland Institute, College of Art. After working in galleries and making websites and videos on the side, I wanted to improve the experiences by making them more valuable, enjoyable, and usable. Hence, I moved to Atlanta and earned an MS in Human-Computer Interaction from Georgia Tech. 
               While I focus on interaction design I love a good helping of visual design when I can get it. I also enjoy jewelry metalsmithing and play backgammon.</p>
