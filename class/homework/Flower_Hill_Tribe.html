		<p>This is going to be a place to document all of the <i>amazing</i>, <b>WILD</b>, and just all around absurd times my friends and I have had at all of the various concerts, shows, and festivals that we've attended and will be attending.</p>

		<p><dfn>Coachella</dfn>, a music Festival in Southern California started the <s>debauchery</s> insanity of everything that has followed:</p><b />
		<ul>
			<li>Knife Party</li>
			<li>Labrinth</li>
			<li>Grace Potter and the Nocturnals</li>
			<li>FUN.</li>
			<li>Avicii</li>
		</ul>

		<p>There is so much yet to come and so much more that went into the past few months that is will take some creative and <em>HARD</em> thinking to document it all.</p>
